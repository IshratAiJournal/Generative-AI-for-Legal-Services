# 📘 Generative AI for Legal Services
## Module 3: Future of Legal Work with Generative AI

### 🔮 What’s Changing?
- Legal workflows will evolve with AI augmentation
- Prompt engineering becomes a crucial legal skill
- Legal professionals must shape AI usage, not just consume outputs

### 📈 Key Changes Expected
- Improved document analysis
- AI-assisted client communication
- Streamlined legal research
- Draft generation and clause comparison

### 🔍 Prompt Engineering Will Matter
> Prompt design = how well the AI performs.

#### Examples:
- **Contract Drafting Prompt**:
  > Draft an NDA between a freelance designer and a marketing agency. Ensure IP protection clauses are included.

- **Prompt Program Using Few-Shot**:
```
Example 1: "This contract clause ensures confidentiality."
Example 2: "This clause defines intellectual property rights."
Now write a clause about non-compete obligations.
```

### 📣 Reflection
- GenAI will make legal work **faster**, but lawyers must learn **prompt literacy**.
- The role of law professionals will evolve into **supervisors**, **verifiers**, and **strategic thinkers**.


### 🛡️ Ethics Reminder
- Keep outputs auditable
- Ensure client data is private
- Use AI to **augment**, not blindly automate
